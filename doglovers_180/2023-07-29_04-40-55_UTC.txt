FOR FOSTER OR ADOPTION - MILO ❤️

Are you looking for an older, lower maintenance doggy who doesn’t ask for much but love and belly rubs? Milo is your guy! 🥰

Milo is around 5-6 years old and is such a ladies man 😂😂 our small team of volunteers all have such a soft spot for this boy & he laps up all the love and cuddles ❤️

Milo was lucky enough to get a sponsor & go on staycation at @bedandbiscuits.ae. He arrived a big chunky hunk at 38kgs 😅 but is now a ‘slender’ 31kgs with all that running and playing he’s been doing 😁

He still has a little way to go to get that hourglass figure but we say thats all the more to love 🥰

Milo has never been given a chance in a home despite his lovely nature & smiley cute face 😞

It’s now his time! He is so lovable & cuddly not to mention a total goofball - he is so funny & will have you in stitches, even just his little face makes us giggle sometimes 😂

Milo is low energy & doesn’t ask for much. He needs someone to keep him relatively active so he doesn’t put the weight back on but he doesn’t need lots of time and attention. A good walk & a good belly rub and he’s happy 🥰

He will need someone to help him settle at first - he can be a little talkative but we find his grumbles endearing, like a little grumpy old man 😂 once he decides you’re his friend, it’s only love from there ❤️

He is good on a leash and was toilet trained. 

Please give the older doggies a chance. The dogs that might not be fluffy or models. The dogs that need a little time but will repay you a hundred times over. The dogs that no one else seems to entertain 🙏

He would do best in a calm home and will do well with or without another dog(s). Will do well with older children (12+) due to his size. Not tested with cats.

He is around 5-6 years old, medium sized desert mix, is fully vaccinated, dewormed, microchipped and neutered ✅

He is looking for a FOSTER or FOREVER home.
